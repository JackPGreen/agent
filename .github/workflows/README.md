## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to:

1. **Build** - Create container images and packages for multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
2. **Test** - Run unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests
3. **Lint** - Validate code quality, Dockerfiles, shell scripts, and GitHub Actions
4. **Package** - Generate distribution packages (DEB, RPM, MSI, PKG)
5. **Release** - Publish releases with signed artifacts and container images
6. **Automate** - Automatically create releases on a schedule

## Workflows

### Filename Conventions

Workflow filenames use a prefix to indicate when they run:

| Prefix | When it runs | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `pr-` | Pull requests only | `pr-container-build.yaml`, `pr-package-build.yaml`, `pr-lint.yaml` |
| `release-` | Version tag pushes (`v*`) only | `release-build.yaml` |
| `cron-` | Scheduled automation and maintenance workflows | `cron-auto-release.yaml`, `cron-lts-update-branches.yaml` |
| `call-` | Reusable workflows (called by other workflows) | `call-build-containers.yaml` |
| _(none)_ | General purpose / mixed triggers | `build.yaml`, `unit-tests.yaml` |

The main CI/CD pipeline is split across three workflow files based on trigger context, so that each only runs what is necessary:

| Workflow | File | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| PR Container Build and Test | [`pr-container-build.yaml`](./pr-container-build.yaml) | Pull requests (path-filtered) |
| PR Package Build and Test | [`pr-package-build.yaml`](./pr-package-build.yaml) | Pull requests |
| Branch Build and Test | [`build.yaml`](./build.yaml) | Push to `main`/`release/**`, manual dispatch |
| Release | [`release-build.yaml`](./release-build.yaml) | Push of version tags (`v*`) |

**Inputs:**

- `version` - Container tag to promote

**Secrets:**

- `github-token` - GitHub token

**Jobs:**

1. **promote-ghcr-images** - Promotes images to top-level GHCR registries
2. **promote-redhat-catalog-images** - Submits UBI images to Red Hat catalog

**Key Features:**

- UBI image promotion to `ghcr.io/telemetryforge/agent:version`
- Debian image promotion to `ghcr.io/telemetryforge/agent:version-slim`

- Skopeo for multi-arch image copying
- Preflight validation before submission

## Composite Actions

### Sign Packages

**File:** [`.github/actions/sign-packages/action.yml`](.github/actions/sign-packages/action.yml)

**Purpose:** Downloads build artefacts, filters development headers/extras, authenticates with GCP, retrieves the GPG key from Secret Manager, and signs all packages. Signed packages are left in `./output/` for the calling job to continue with.

Used by the `staging-upload` job in `build.yaml` and the `release` job in `release-build.yaml`.

**Steps performed:**
1. Download `*package*` artifacts into `output/`
2. Filter out header and extra packages (`.rpm`, `.deb` variants)
3. Install signing tools (`createrepo-c`, `rpm`, `debsigs`, `coreutils`)
4. Authenticate with GCP via OIDC
5. Retrieve GPG key and passphrase from GCP Secret Manager
6. Import GPG key
7. Run `./scripts/sign-packages.sh`

### Get Package Name
**File:** [`.github/actions/get-package-name/action.yml`](.github/actions/get-package-name/action.yml)

**Purpose:** Converts distribution names to standardized package artifact names.

**Inputs:**

- `distro` - Distribution name (e.g., `centos/7`, `ubuntu/24.04`)

**Outputs:**

- `package-name` - Formatted package name (e.g., `package-centos-7`, `package-ubuntu-24.04`)

**Usage:**

```yaml
- name: Get package name
  uses: ./.github/actions/get-package-name
  id: get_package_name
  with:
    distro: "ubuntu/24.04"

- name: Use package name
  run: echo "${{ steps.get_package_name.outputs.package-name }}"
```

## Configuration Files

### build-config.json

**File:** [`build-config.json`](../build-config.json)

Contains build configuration including:

- `linux_targets` - Full list of Linux distributions for PR builds
- `release.linux_targets` - Reduced list for main/release builds
- `kind_versions` - Kubernetes versions for testing

Example structure:

```json
{
  "linux_targets": [
    "almalinux/8",
    "ubuntu/24.04",
    "debian/bookworm"
  ],
  "release": {
    "linux_targets": [
      "ubuntu/24.04",
      "ubuntu/24.04.arm64v8"
    ]
  },
  "kind_versions": [
    "v1.31.12",
    "v1.32.8"
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

Common environment variables used across workflows:

- `TELEMETRY_FORGE_AGENT_VERSION` - Version being built
- `TELEMETRY_FORGE_AGENT_IMAGE` - Container image name
- `TELEMETRY_FORGE_AGENT_TAG` - Container image tag
- `FLUENT_BIT_BINARY` - Path to Fluent Bit binary for testing
- `FLB_NIGHTLY_BUILD` - Nightly build information
- `VCPKG_BUILD_TYPE` - vcpkg build type (Windows)
- `KIND_VERSION` - Kubernetes version for testing

## Runner Labels

Runner selection for reusable workflows is centralized inside the reusable workflow definitions via repository variables. Callers do not pass runner-label inputs.

The workflows support different runner types:

- `ubuntu-latest` - Standard GitHub-hosted runners
- `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest` - Namespace runners (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM)
- `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest-4cpu-16gb` - Larger Namespace runners
- `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest-arm` - ARM64 Namespace runners
- `macos-15` - macOS Apple Silicon
- `macos-15-intel` - macOS Intel
- `windows-2025` - Windows Server 2025

Reusable workflows derive Linux runner labels from these repository variables:

- `vars.LINUX_AMD_RUNNER` (default: `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest`)
- `vars.LINUX_AMD_LARGE_RUNNER` (default: `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest-4cpu-16gb`)
- `vars.LINUX_ARM_RUNNER` (default: `namespace-profile-ubuntu-latest-arm`)
- `vars.LINUX_S390X_RUNNER` (default: `ubuntu-24.04-s390x`)

## Secrets

Required secrets for workflows:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `DOCKERHUB_PUBLIC_READ_TOKEN` - Docker Hub read-only token
- `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY` - Cosign signing key
- `COSIGN_PASSWORD` - Cosign key password
- `GITHUB_CI_PAT` - Personal access token for triggering workflows
- `RHEL_AGENT_PUBLISH_API_KEY` - Red Hat API key for certification

## Best Practices

1. **PR Labels** - Use labels to control workflow execution:
   - `build-packages` - Build all packages
   - `build-linux` - Build Linux packages only
   - `build-windows` - Build Windows packages only
   - `build-macos` - Build macOS packages only

2. **Testing** - All changes should pass:
   - Unit tests with sanitizers
   - Linting (Hadolint, Shellcheck, Actionlint)
   - Functional tests (BATS)
   - Integration tests (on target OS)
   - Kubernetes tests (multiple versions)

3. **Releases** - Version tags trigger full release:
   - Build all platforms
   - Run all tests
   - Create GitHub release
   - Sign container images
   - Generate SBOMs
   - Update documentation

4. **Versioning**:
   - LTS: `v25.10.x`, `v26.4.x` (incremental)
   - Mainline: `vYY.M.W` (year.month.week)

5. **Reusable Workflow Permissions**:
  - Jobs that call reusable workflows should set explicit `permissions` matching the called workflow requirements (for example `packages: write` and `id-token: write` for container build/sign paths).
  - Do not rely on implicit defaults for reusable calls.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. Check runner logs for specific errors
2. Verify dependencies are available
3. Check vcpkg cache for Windows builds
4. Verify Docker image availability for Linux builds

### Test Failures

1. Review BATS test output
2. Check Kubernetes cluster logs
3. Verify package installation on target OS
4. Review coverage reports for unit tests

### Release Issues

1. Verify tag format matches `v*`
2. Check all tests passed
3. Verify secrets are configured
4. Check GCP authentication for version updates

## Contributing

When adding new workflows:

1. Use reusable workflows for common patterns
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Update this README with new workflows
4. Add mermaid diagrams for complex flows
5. Test with dry-run or PR labels first
